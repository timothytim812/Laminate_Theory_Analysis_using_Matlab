Here's a detailed guide on the application of this laminate theory code for analyzing fiber-reinforced composites. 

It includes the calculations for determining optimum twist angles, material stiffness, and failure stress criteria in composite materials. 
Key parameters like fiber orientation angles, layer thickness, and mechanical properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, tensile and compressive strengths) are defined. 
This code also has the method for calculating laminate stiffness matrices, transformation matrices for different layers, and maximum failure stress criteria, along with graphical representations of the results.
